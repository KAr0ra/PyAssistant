### Prerequisites
Please install all prerequisites to ensure PyAssistant will run on your system.

```
Python3
Twilio 
Speech_recognition
Requests
OpenCV
Numpy
```
Please ensure that your system has a webcam with mic built-in or by USB

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
